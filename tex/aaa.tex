  %%%%%% ABSTRACT %%%%%%
%%  ABSTRACT:
\vspace{-0.2cm}
 % what:
% RNA secondary structure prediction is a well-known problem, and it has been used for medical design. 
RNA secondary structure prediction 
% is an important problem which has a series of downstream applications.
is widely used to understand RNA function.
% Compared with MFE-based methods, partition function-based methods have gained more and more attention due to their higher accuracy and ability to predict pseudoknots.
Recently, there has been a shift away from the classical minimum free energy (MFE) methods to partition function-based 
% ones that assemble structures with base pairing probabilities. 
methods that account for folding ensembles and can therefore estimate structure and base pair probabilities. 
% why:
% However, partition function calculation, as well as the downstream base pairing probability prediction, uses cubic algorithm and is slow. This slowness is even more severe than cubic MFE-based methods because of the larger cost in the inner loop. 
However, the classic partition function algorithm scales cubically with sequence length, 
and 
% suffers slowness 
is therefore a slow calculation
for long sequences.
This slowness is even more severe than cubic-time MFE-based methods due to a larger constant factor in runtime.
% how:
% To address this, we present \linearpartition, a novel algorithm that can calculate partition function and base pairing probability in both linear runtime and linear memory space with RNA sequence length.
% Recently, \linearfold introduced to MFE-based method with a novel dynamic programming parsing and beam search pruning borrowed from computational linguistic, 
% and achieves even higher prediction accuracy with significantly reduced computation time.
Inspired by the success of \linearfold algorithm that computes the MFE structure in linear time,
we address this issue by proposing a similar linear-time heuristic algorithm,
\linearpartition, to approximate the partition function 
and base pairing probabilities.
% To address this issue, we present a linear-time heristic algorithm, \linearpartition, to approximate the partition function 
% and base pairing probabilities,
% inspired by the recently proposed LinearFold algorithm
% which compute MFE structure in linear time. 
% To further accelarate partition function-based method, we present \linearpartition, which inherits \linearfold main idea and applies it to  
% partition function and base pairing probability calculation, 
% and leads to a small accuracy improvement in both linear runtime and linear memory space.
% wow:
% \linearpartition reduces classical cubic runtime by pruning states with lower energy. Although it neglects some substructure, but only the ones with worse free energy are given up, and results in a similar partition function as exact search. \linearpartition is 10$\times$ faster than \viennarnafold for the longest sequence (about 3000 nucleotides) in the dataset. Not only fast, \linearpartition is as accurate as \viennarnafold when comparing MEA and ProbKnot output structure. 
% Surprisingly, even though \linearpartition uses an inexact search, it achieves better accuracy on longer families (16S and 23S rRNA).
\linearpartition is 
% 11$\times$ faster than \viennarnafold for the longest sequence (2,968 nucleotides) in ArchiveII dataset, 
% and 
256$\times$ faster than \viennarnafold
for a sequence with length 15,780,
and 2,771$\times$ faster than \contrafold
for a sequence with length 32,753.
% for the longest sampled sequence (15,780 nucleotides) from RNAcentral that \viennarnafold can run.
% should mentioned contrafold?
Interestingly, although \linearpartition is approximate, 
it runs in linear time without sacrificing accuracy 
when 
% applied to downstream structure prediction tasks such as MEA and ThreshKnot (a thresholded version of ProbKnot), 
base pair probabilities are used to assemble structures,
and even leads to a small accuracy improvement on longer families (16S and 23S rRNA).
  \vspace{-0.6cm}
  %% The idea is based on 
  %% complexity by incrementally labeling the nucleotides with dynamic programming
  %% and beam search pruning.
  %% By adapting our approach to both machine-learned and thermodynamic models, the
  %% results on several datasets show that our approach outperforms all previous
  %% methods in accuracy, while using significantly reduced amounts of time.
