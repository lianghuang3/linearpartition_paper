1. what is a good way to illustrate the method

2. Introduction
	2.1 figure
	ensemble: show a ribol switch or a good switch??
	stotastical sampling from distribution

	better: prob. tells about ensemble (motivation)

	even for coding RNA. mRNA thousands structures 
	protein binding site (mRNA)
	RNA structure decides the binding site.
	RNA turn over, decay

	paper reading

	in linear time capture ... 

	number of information/states


3. Results
	first add figure to visulize algorithm
	added free energy of ensemble followed runtime 

	search quality -> approximation quality (*)

	3.1 runtime: add longer sequence from RNAcentral -Yes
	3.2 show both MEA and ProbKnot results in main or one in SI.
	3.3 A better way to show example?
	3.4 any other results which should be added


	efficiency -> accuracy (has gold standard) -> approximation quality 
	use matrix to ensemble structure 

	accuracy: use threshknot, include in SI. discribe the correlations

	accuracy bar plots: remove MFE (kept)

	RMSD figure: what is the accuracy of the outlayer

	identify region ??
	correlation (within family) between entropy and RMSD

	gutell: compare of rna website

4. title?
