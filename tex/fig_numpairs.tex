\caption{
  Although the total number of possible base pairings scales $O(n^2)$ with the sequence length $n$
  (using the probability matrix from \viennarnafold as an example),
  with any reasonable threshold $\theta$, the number of surviving pairings (in colors for different $\theta$) grows linearly,
  suggesting our approximation, only computing $O(n)$ pairings, is reasonable.
