# LinearPartition Paper

This is the LaTeX source for the [arXiv version](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.13190) of the LinearPartition paper.

The published version is [here](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/36/Supplement_1/i258/5870487), but the arXiv version is much preferred because 

- it contains the Appendix in the same PDF (so  the main text has clickable hyperrefs to figures/tables in the Appendix).
- it was typeset by LaTeX instead of the publisher's Word-like system.

The pseudocode for the partition function (inside) is in [`fig_pseudocode.tex`](fig_pseudocode.tex).
