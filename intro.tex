% Secondary structure prediction problem, 
% though still difficult, 
% is well-defined in mathematics formation, and can be suitable modeled with the decomposable substructures. 
% Utilizing this decomposable nature, 
RNA secondary structure prediction is NP-complete~\cite{Pedersen+:2000},
but nested (i.e., pseudoknot-free) secondary structures can be predicted with
cubic-time dynamic programming algorithms. 
% based on an important paradigm free energy minimization 
Commonly, the minimum free energy (MFE) 
structure is predicted~\cite{nussinov+jacobson:1980, zuker+stiegler:1981}.
% when a single structure is expected.
% and some prediction systems based on these algorithms, such as RNAstructure \cite{mathews+turner:2006}, \contrafold \cite{do+:2006} and \viennarnafold \cite{lorenz+:2011}, 
% have greatly improved the accuracy of prediction and are widely used.
% MEA -> partition function 
% For a given sequence, predicting the structure of minimum free energy (MFE) under certain free energy model by dynamic programming is a classical method for RNA secondary structure prediction. 
% cted.Free energy minimization is an important paradigm for predicting structure when a single structure is expe
% In the absence of many homologous sequences, the accuracy of MFE structure is 73\% in average \cite{mathews:2004}.
% However, this method assumes all thermodynamic parameters are correct and the energy model is perfect, which are both no the case in reality.
% Also, this method neglects the facts that multiple conformations exits at equilibrium \cite{mathews:2004}.
% This method

% it neglects the fact that

multiple conformations exist

as an equilibrium ensemble 
for one RNA sequence~\cite{mathews:2004}.
For example, many mRNAs {\textit {in vivo}} form a dynamic equilibrium 
and fold into a population of structures~\cite{Long+:2007, Lu+:2008, Tafer+:2008, lai+:2018}; 
% as well as abandons all pseudoknotted structures.
% Many RNA sequences, for example mRNAs, exist in a thermodynamic ensemble of structures 
% \cite{lai+:2018}.%[53].
% As an alternative, partition function-based method \cite{mccaskill:1990} provides an ensemble of all pseudoknot-free structures, and based on it base pairing probabilities and structural entropy \cite{Huynen+} can be calculated.  
% As an alternative, 
Figure~\ref{fig:overview}A--B shows the example of Tebowned RNA
which folds into more than one structure at equilibrium.

% While TBWN-B, which has two short helices at 5'-end, takes up $27 \pm 12\%$ of ensemble.
% Besides TBWN-A and TBWN-B illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:overview}, Tebowned RNA can also fold into the state of TBWN-C

is not expressive enough to capture multiple states of RNA sequences %Tebowned RNA %folding.

% Rather than predicting one single stucture,

% Partition function, the sum of equilibrium constants for all possible secondary structures,

Alternatively, we can compute the partition function,

The partition function calculation can also be used to 
calculate base pairing probabilities of each nucleotide $i$ 
paired with each of possible nucleotides $j$~\cite{mccaskill:1990, mathews:2004}.

In addition to model multiple states at equilibrium, 
base pairing probabilities are used for downstream prediction methods, 
such as maximum expected accuracy (MEA)~\cite{Knudsen+Hein:2003, do+:2006}, 
to assemble a structure with improved accuracy compared with the MFE structure~\cite{lu+:2009}.
% As a by-product, the pair probabilities also enable maximum expected accuracy (MEA) structure prediction 
% \cite{do+:2006, lu+:2009}. % [29, 62].
Other downstream prediction methods, 
such as 
% HotKnot \cite{Ren+:2005}, % not based on partition function
ProbKnot~\cite{bellaousov+mathews:2010}, 
ThreshKnot~\cite{Zhang+:2019},
DotKnot~\cite{Sperschneider+Datta:2010} 
and IPknot~\cite{sato+:2011},
use base pairing probabilities to predict pseudoknotted structures with heuristics,
which is beyond the scope of standard cubic-time algorithms.
Additionally, the partition function 
% can also be applied to do stochastic sampling based on the ensemble distribution
is the basis of stochastic sampling, 
in which structures are sampled with their probability of occurring 
in the Boltzmann ensemble~\cite{Ding+Lawrence:2003, mathews:2006}.

% Moreover, although partition function-based method excluded pseudoknotted structures during dynamic programming process, 
% it is able to predict pseudoknotted base pairs and structure by using pair probability matrix, and pseudoknotted prediction systems such as HotKnot \cite{Ren+:2005}, ProbKnot \cite{bellaousov+mathews:2010}, DotKnot \cite{Sperschneider+Datta:2010} and IPknot \cite{Sato+:2011} all take pair probability matrix as inputs. 
% Figure~\ref{tRNA} compares MFE-based and partition function-based methods.
% Furthermore, single structure prediction based on partition function calculation, such as maximum expected accuracy (MEA) ThreshKnot \cite{do+:2006, threshknot}, achieves higher accuracy in average. 


% speed
Therefore, there has been a shift from the classical MFE-based methods to partition function-based ones.
These latter methods, 
as well as the prediction engines based on them, such as partition function-mode of RNAstructure~\cite{mathews+turner:2006}, 
\viennarnafold~\cite{lorenz+:2011}, 
and \contrafold~\cite{do+:2006},
are all based on the seminal algorithm that McCaskill pioneered~\cite{mccaskill:1990}.
It employs a dynamic program to capture all possible (exponentially many) nested structures,
but its $O(n^3)$ runtime still scales poorly for longer sequences. 
This slowness %of partition function-based methods
is even more severe than the $O(n^3)$-time MFE-based ones
%with the same $O(n^3)$ time complexity
due to a much larger constant factor.
For instance, for 
% {\it E.~coli} 
{\it H.~pylori} 23S rRNA (sequence length 2,968~{\it nt}),
\viennarnafold's %(version 2.4.11)
computation of the partition function and base pairing probabilities
is 9$\times$ slower than MFE (71 vs.~8 secs),

prevents their applications to longer sequences.
% 132.248859 contrafold

% , which is more than 9 $\times$ slower. 
% because function-based method takes two-round cubic loops for inside-outside calculation.

To address this $O(n^3)$-time bottleneck, %alleviate the cubic-factor slowness, 
we present \linearpartition, 
which is inspired by our %efficient linearization idea of \linearfold \cite{huang+:2019}
recently proposed \linearfold algorithm~\cite{huang+:2019} 
that approximates the MFE structure in linear time.
Using the same idea, \linearpartition can approximate
the partition function and base pairing probability matrix in linear time.
% Recently, \linearfold \cite{huang+:2019} 
% presents the first linear-time and linear-space MFE-based RNA folding prediction system.
% For the same 
% % {\it E.~coli} 
% {\it H.~pylori} 23S rRNA, \linearfold spends about 2 seconds, leading to a 4$\times$ runtime decrease.
% % Overall, \linearfold achieves significant efficiency and scalability improvement and higher accuracy.

% Inspired by the efficient linearization idea of \linearfold, we present \linearpartition,

% addressing speed bottleneck in existing systems.
% Similar as \linearfold, 
Like \linearfold,
\linearpartition % incrementally 
scans the RNA sequence from 5'-to-3'
using a left-to-right dynamic program that runs in $O(n^3)$ time,
but unlike the classical bottom-up McCaskill algorithm~\cite{mccaskill:1990} with the same speed,
our left-to-right scanning makes it possible to apply the beam pruning heuristic~\cite{Huang+Sagae:2010} 
%to narrow down the search space, 
to achieve linear runtime in practice; see Fig~\ref{fig:overview}D.
 % with substructure of lower energy.
% and only retain states with top $b$ free energy of ensemble (inside score), 
% where $b$ is the beam size.
% Though introducing beam prune to filter some structures,
Although the search is approximate,
the well-designed heuristic ensures 
%that only states with worse ensemble free energy
the surviving structures capture the bulk of the free energy of the ensemble.
It is important to note that, unlike local folding methods in Fig.~\ref{fig:overview}D,
our algorithm does {\em not} impose any limit on the base-pairing distance;
in other words, it is a {\em global} partition function algorithm.
%and the resulting partition function is close to the exact version.

%  (inside score) 
% are pruned,
% and partition function is still similar as optimal algorithm.
% and the majority is catched.

More interestingly, as Figure~\ref{fig:linearpairs} shows,
even with the $O(n^3)$-time McCaskill algorithm, %(like the one implemented in \viennarnafold),
the resulting number of base pairings with reasonable probabilities (e.g., >0.001)
grows only linearly with the sequence length.
This suggests that our algorithm, which only computes $O(n)$ pairings by design,
is a reasonable approximation.

% \linearpartition, inherits efficiency and accuracy of \linearfold. 

% \linearpartition is 11$\times$ faster than \viennarnafold for the longest sequence ({\it H.~pylori} 23S rRNA, 2,968 nucleotides) in the ArchiveII dataset,
% and 256$\times$ faster for the longest sampled sequence (15,780 nucleotides) from RNAcentral that \viennarnafold can run.
\linearpartition is 2,771$\times$ faster than \contrafold for the longest sequence (32,753~{\it nt})
% 32,767 nucleotides) 
that \contrafold can run 
in the dataset (2.5 days vs.~1.3 min.).
% Meanwhile, \linearpartition leads to a small improvement on PPV and Sensitivity compared with \viennarnafold.
% % in both MEA and ThreshKnot prediction 
% % using the probability matrix computed in linear time.
% Surprisingly, \linearpartition achieves higher accuracy improvement on longer families (16S and 23S rRNA).
Interestingly, \linearpartition is orders of magnitude faster {\em without} sacrificing accuracy.
In fact, the resulting base pairing probabilities are even better correlated with ground truth structures,
and 
when applied to downstream structure prediction tasks,
%such as MEA and ThreshKnot (a thresholded version of ProbKnot),
they lead to a small accuracy improvement on longer families (small and large subunit rRNA),
as well as a substantial accuracy improvement on long-distance base pairs (500+ \nts apart).

% \end{itemize}

% more striking than LinearFold
Although both \linearpartition and \linearfold use linear-time beam search,
the success of the former is arguably more surprising,
since rather than finding one single optimal structure, 
\linearpartition needs to sum up exponentially many structures
that capture the bulk part of the ensemble free energy.
% For users, 
\linearpartition also results in more accurate downstream structure predictions than \linearfold.
%and is able to serve tasks such as pseudoknot prediction and accessibility calculation.
