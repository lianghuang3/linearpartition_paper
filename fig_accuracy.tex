\caption{Accuracy of downstream  predictions (MEA and \threshknot) using base pairing probabilities from \viennarnafold and \linearpartition
        on the ArchiveII dataset.
	{\bf A}: Overall PPV-Sensitivity tradeoff of MFE (single point) and MEA with varying $\gamma$
	%MFE is a single point, but
        (which can be tuned for higher sensitivity or PPV by adjusting $\gamma$).
	{\bf B} \& {\bf C}: PPV and Sensitivity comparisons of MEA structures for each family.
  {\bf D}: Accuracy comparison of long-distance base pairs (>500 \nts apart) in the MEA structures.
        {\bf E--H}: Same as {\bf A--D}, but using \threshknot predictions instead of MEA.
	%% {\bf D}: Overall PPV-Sensitivity tradeoff of \threshknot with varying threshold $\theta$.
	%% {\bf E} and {\bf F}: PPV and Sensitivity comparisons of ThreshKnot structures for each family.
        %	For easy comparison, {\bf A} and {\bf D} and also {\bf BCEF} are on the same scales.
        We conclude that MEA predictions based on \linearpartitionv are consistently better in both PPV and Sensitivity than
        those based on \viennarnafold for all $\gamma$'s,
        while \threshknot predictions based on those two are almost identical for all $\theta$'s.
        \linearpartitionv is  substantially better on long-distance base pairs in both MEA and \threshknot predictions.
