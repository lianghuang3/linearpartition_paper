Articles begin with an unreferenced abstract (typically 150 words) and are divided into separate sections for Introduction, Results, Discussion and online Methods. Introduction and Discussion are brief and focused, the Results section usually contains a general description of the method followed by its validation, and the online Methods section provides all technical details necessary for the independent reproduction of the methodology, without referring to a chain of bibliographical references. The main text (excluding abstract, online Methods, references and figure legends) is 2,500 - 3500 words. Articles have no more than 6 display items (figures and tables). The Results and online Methods should be divided by topical subheadings; the Discussion may contain subheadings at the editors' discretion. As a guideline, Articles allow up to 40 references.
